A visionary map with noise values

Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise used to generate textures that appear natural.
It avoids the blocky look by cleverly blending (interpolating) between random values, resulting in smooth variations.

By passing the x and y coordinates to the noise() function you can obtain a controlled random value between 0 and 1. You can use this value to choose which shape and color to draw.

By changing the coordinates over time, it is possible to move around your visionary map.
