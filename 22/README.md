Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise used to generate textures that appear natural. It achieves this by interpolating between random values in a way that creates gradual changes, rather than abrupt jumps.

By passing the x and y coordinates to the noise() function you can obtain a controlled random value between 0 and 1. You can use this value to choose which shape and color to draw.

By changing the coordinates over time, it is possible to move around the imaginary map.
