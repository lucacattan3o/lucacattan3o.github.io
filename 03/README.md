How could some squares become a sphere?

Each square is just scaling up and down. The logic here is in the offset of the animation of each square.
The offset is calculated based on the distance from the center of the canvas.

There's still a lot to discover for me in sinusoidal movements but this kind of coding is making me really happy.. and that's a lot! :)
