#Sketch 09

Self portrait

I remembered a beautyful sketch made by @loading_page (go and see his work!), so I started working with image loading, reading pixels and using the data to draw different shapes.

Then I thought, why not use pixel lightness as a parameter to modulate a simple animation? A little bit strange, not so easy... but it worked!
