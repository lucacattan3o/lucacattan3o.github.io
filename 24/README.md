# Sketch 24

Generating some depth maps that resemble excavations and rivers for Metronimie Festival.

I'm working on a digital tool for the project "Del nostro scavo continuo" with Emanuele Caprioli, Caterina Duf√¨ and Simone Spampinato (@mevlido_ @emanuelecaprioli @viperavu).

I've gathered here some early experiments created with particles that move specularly following the direction defined by the Perlin noise.

There's still work to be done; in the meantime I leave a trace of mypersonal excavation.
