#Sketch 07

A pattern of arcs.

How to get always a different colors for background and the arc?

The easiest way I found is to shuffle the color palette before drawing each item in the grid.
After the shuffle you could use always the first and the second color of the palette.

Just vanilla javascript and p5.js
