It's really difficult for a human to draw a perfect circle.
For a computer it's basic stuff.

But what if we want a computer to draw a circle like a human?
Interesting challenge ;)

You start drawing some points using sin() and cos() to create a perfect circle.
Then you would move them around a bit using a noise() function, reaching some good results.

So, let's have the computer draw thousands of imperfect circles, one on top of the other.

Inspired by a work of Tim Holman.
Only 60 lines of code in vanilla javascript and p5.js.
