## Raw shader

These days I'm working on a new tool with p5.js that translates the brightness values of the image captured from a camera into a composition of simple geometric shapes: squares, triangles, circles..

I also spent a lot of time optimizing the process of recording the loop values ​​and exporting them later in a video with a capturer (CCapture).
Everything is managed with the lil-gui library (essential).

Is anyone interested in testing it?
