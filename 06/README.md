#Sketch 06

I am fascinated about let the computer make decisions. Starting from a really simple one, like choosing a color.
The result is unpredictable and a simple sketch can produce interesting and different outputs every time.

In the last image, a basic script to get a random color from a palette.

What if we would like to get always a different color for the square and the circle?
Let's try that in the next sketch ;)

Just vanilla javascript and p5.js
