Random Walker

Inspired by some visuals created by @andrewmcwhae (check out his great work!), I decided to build a tool to customize random walker behavior.

A random walker is a mathematical model of a path that consists of a succession of random steps.

Adding animations took several hours, but it was definitely worth it :)
