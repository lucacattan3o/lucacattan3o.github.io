Circle packing and matter.js

Circle packing is a cool technique where an algorithm tries to fill a space with random growing circles.
When a circle touches another circle or the edges, it simply stops growing.

Here I mixed the circle packing with some physics using matter.js: so all circles are pushing each other in this colorfull jellyish effect.
The best part is that you can annoy them with your mouse. :)

All written in vanilla javascript and p5.js.
