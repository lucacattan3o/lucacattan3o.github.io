#Sketch 16

Working on a space / time simulation - one of mine favourite subjects - I started with a grid of particles diplaced one the space.
Then I simulated a mass in the middle and when I applyed a force to each items, everything start dancing, it was thrilling.
Each items has a position vector, a velocity vector and an acceleration vector all chained togheter. 

Thanks to Daniel Shiffman for all his lessons in the The Nature of Code serie, super illuminating.

Finally this week I'm also in time (hopefully) with the weekly prompt from @creativecodeart!
