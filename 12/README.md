#Sketch 12

I started working on this sketch trying to recreate a great peace named 'the factory' made by @rtbyts (go and check his incredible work!).

I arranged many cubes in a three-dimensional grid, hidden some of them and assigned different colors randomly: the perspective effect was really nice and magic.

[1] After a while I tried moving them towards the camera, deleting them as they got closer to the camera and spawning new ones in the back (that was the tricky part).

[2] Then, playing with dimensions and speed I suddenly got a Star Wars effect :D
