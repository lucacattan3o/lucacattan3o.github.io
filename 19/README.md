#Sketch 19

This is a tool to show the HSB color space. I started working at it this summer in Denmark when I was learning a lot about colors: @70magenta was sending me several documents with theory and practical examples.


HSB stands for hue-saturation-brightness, and is a far more human-friendly way of describing color.

Hue is a number from 0 to 360 and it's easy to represent as a color wheel: 0° is  red, 120° is green.

Saturation is a number from 0 to 100. 100  means 100% saturation = the richest possible version of that color (the items at the edges of the cylinder). In the center you have instead 0 saturation.

Brighhtenes is a number from 0 to 100. 0 means no brightness = black. In the cylinder I represented by the vertical axis. On top you have 100 brightness.
