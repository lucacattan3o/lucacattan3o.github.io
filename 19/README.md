#Sketch 19

This is a tool to show the HSB color space. I started working at it this summer in Denmark when I was learning a lot about colors: @70magenta was sending me several documents with theory and practical examples.


HSB stands for hue-saturation-brightness, and is a far more human-friendly way of describing color than RGB.

Hue is a number from 0 to 360 and it's easy to represent it as a color wheel: 0째 is  red, 120째 is green, 240째 is blue, 360째 is red again.

Saturation is a number from 0 to 100. 100  means 100% saturation = the richest possible version of that color (the items at the external edges of the cylinder). In the center you have instead 0 saturation.

Brighhtenes is a number from 0 to 100. 0 means no brightness = black. In the cylinder it is represented by the vertical axis. On top you have 100 brightness.

Using the slider you can choose how many subdivisions of these three parameters you want to explore this color space.

Animating all the items with a delay based on the parameter you can get some super nice effect.

Try it ;)
