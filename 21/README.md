Sketch 21

Another beautyfull secret based on sine and cosine.

A Lissajous curve, also known as Lissajous figure, is the graph of a system of parametric equations which describe the position of two perpendicular oscillations in x and y directions of different angular frequency (a and b). â€“ Wikipedia

In these weeks at the Scuola Holden we worked with Lissajous curves to draw several geometries.
It's all about oscillations: sine and cosine.

Following some works coded by the students
