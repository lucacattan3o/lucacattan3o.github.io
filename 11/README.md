#Sketch 11

Experimenting with 3D and perlin noise.

In this sketch I used the noise() function (build in p5.js) to get the height of a particular point of the terrain. To get the moving effect I just needed to shift the values passed to the noise(x, y) function!

Using just a random value for each point of terrain wouldn't result in a terrain shape - it would be just a mess :)

Many thanks to @dshiffman for all the coding lessons I've taken over the years through @the.coding.train channel.
Super inspiring, with a lovely way of explaining even difficult topics.
