#Sketch 08

1. You start drawing a triangle on a square.. nice.
2. Of course you will choose random colors from your palette, just because you know how to do it :D
3. Then you start rotating your sketch by 90° 180° 27° randomly..
4. Then you think, why not animate it?
5. But - since the colors are random - you have to use an array of objects and store all the informations :/
6. Refactory with array of objects.
7. Then you start moving just one vertex of the triangle using a cosine function; interesting..
8. You increase the number of the items and.. wow, wait.. wtf is that?!
9. You are happy.

This is the beauty that lies in the creative coding process.
You're not aware of what you are doing most of the time; you start drawing something.. as a scribble on a piece of paper.
But instead of the paper, you have the power of a computer that can do the job for you.. and javascript and p5.js as friends.

Would you like to try?
